2D Kalman filter can be used to find velocity from position
The velocity is implied
The veloity can be used to infer the acceleration
This acceleration reading can be corelated with the Zephyr sensor
### High Dimensional Gaussian
Mean is replaced with a vector
Variance is replaced with coveriance
Formula can be looked up and doesn't need to be remembered
